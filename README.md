# Harmony Plot

A little python program to visualize the musical scales and help out while playing guitar. 
The six strings of the guitar were drawn as six horizontal lines (y=1, y=2 ...), the x-axis specifies the number of the fret.
Knowing that there are 12 notes in an octave and that each scale has a specific pattern (fixed intervals between notes) one can access the notes of any scale using indexes.
- With two menus you can select for the scale and root note you are looking for. 
- Clicking a button shows where the notes are located in the first octave of the guitar.
